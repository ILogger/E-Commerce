It's draw.io architecture diagram.

Concept is that website with products will be on cloud, and payment stuff, users on premise.

Questions to answer:
- How to sync product browsing with payment
- What kind of architecture would be ideal
- Maybe starting from the point when I have on-premisse website, and split modules to the cloud would be more accurate.
